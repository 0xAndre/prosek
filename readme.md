Prosek is designed to analyze running processes and their dependencies using VirusTotal. <br>

Prosek offers a comprehensive solution for monitoring and assessing the activities taking place within your system. By leveraging the capabilities of VirusTotal, a leading online virus scanning service, Prosek provides real-time analysis of processes and their associated dependencies, ensuring a robust and secure computing environment. <br>

Prosek goes beyond process analysis by examining their dependencies. It identifies the files and resources utilized by each process, highlighting potential vulnerabilities or risks associated with third-party components. This comprehensive approach allows for proactive threat detection and effective mitigation of potential security breaches.
